      <h3>Extension Depot Belongs to the Community</h3>

      <p>Extension Depot belongs to the community. While Chef has the responsibility to keep it running and be stewards of its functionality, what it does and how it works is driven by the community. The <a href="https://github.com/chef/supermarket">chef/supermarket</a> repository will continue to be where development of the Extension Depot application takes place. Come be part of shaping the direction of Extension Depot by opening issues and pull requests or by joining us on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chef-supermarket">Extension Depot mailing list</a> or in <a href="https://gitter.im/chef/supermarket">Gitter</a>.</p>
