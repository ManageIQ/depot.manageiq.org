# +Curry::PullRequestAnnotator+ instances interact with GitHub Pull Requests
# based on the commit authors' signed CLA statuses. It uses the Octokit gem to
# interact with the GitHub API.
#
# The main functionality of the +Curry::PullRequestAnnotator+ is to either add a
# label to a Pull Request if all of the commit authors in a Pull Request have signed
# a CLA or to leave a comment if there are any commit authors who have not signed a
# CLA.
#
# A +Curry::PullRequestAnnotator+ is instantiated when a
# +Curry::ClaValidationWorker+ is performing its job.
#
class Curry::PullRequestAnnotator
  #
  # Creates a new annotator for the given +Curry::PullRequest+
  #
  # @param [PullRequest] pull_request

  #
  # The main method for the Annotator. If all of the commit authors within a
  # pull request are signers of a CLA, add a label to the Pull Request that
  # says so. If there are any commit authors who are not signers of a CLA, add a
  # comment letting the users who have not signed a CLA know they need to
  # before the PR can be merged in.
  #
  # @note In the future it may be wise to keep track of PR state, and to only
  # carry out the annotation if the PR is still open.
